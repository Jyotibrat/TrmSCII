# Archive Directory

This directory contains archived code from the TrmSCII project.

## Purpose

The Archive directory serves as a repository for:

- **Legacy Code**: Previous implementations or versions of features that are no longer in active use
- **Deprecated Components**: Code that has been replaced by newer, more efficient implementations
- **Reference Material**: Historical code that may serve as reference for future development or debugging
- **Backup Code**: Important code segments preserved for potential future use or analysis

## Contents

This directory currently contains:
- **School.java**

## Usage Guidelines

### For Developers
- Code in this directory is **not part of the active codebase**
- These files are preserved for historical reference and should not be imported into current builds
- Before removing any code from the main project, consider archiving it here if it contains valuable logic or implementations

### Code Review
- Archived code may contain useful patterns, algorithms, or approaches that could be adapted for future features
- When implementing new features, check archived code for similar functionality that might provide insights

## Note

While this code is archived, it remains part of the project's development history and may contain valuable intellectual property and design decisions that contributed to the evolution of TrmSCII.
